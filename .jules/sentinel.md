## 2024-05-22 - Hardcoded SendGrid API Key
**Vulnerability:** A hardcoded SendGrid API key was found in `controller/user/products.js`. This key allows unauthorized actors to send emails on behalf of the application, potentially leading to phishing campaigns or spam.
**Learning:** Hardcoded credentials in source code are a common but critical vulnerability. They are easily discovered by automated scanners.
**Prevention:** Always use environment variables for third-party API keys. Ensure `.env` files are in `.gitignore`.
