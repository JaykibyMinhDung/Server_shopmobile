## 2024-05-22 - Hardcoded SendGrid API Key
**Vulnerability:** A hardcoded SendGrid API key was found in `controller/user/products.js`. This key allows unauthorized actors to send emails on behalf of the application, potentially leading to phishing campaigns or spam.
**Learning:** Hardcoded credentials in source code are a common but critical vulnerability. They are easily discovered by automated scanners.
**Prevention:** Always use environment variables for third-party API keys. Ensure `.env` files are in `.gitignore`.

## 2024-05-23 - Sensitive Data in Query Params
**Vulnerability:** The signup endpoint (`controller/user/auth.js`) was retrieving sensitive user data (password, PII) from `req.query`.
**Learning:** Developers might mistakenly use `req.query` in POST requests if not familiar with Express request objects, leading to credentials being logged in access logs and browser history.
**Prevention:** Always enforce use of `req.body` for POST/PUT requests handling sensitive data. Ensure body parsing middleware is configured.
